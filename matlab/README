Introduction
============

GURLS - (Grand Unified Regularized Least Squares) is a MATLAB software package for regression and 
(multiclass) classifiers based on the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) loss function. 

Installation
============

Open MATLAB and execute:

>> run('PACKAGEROOT/gurls/utils/gurls_install.m');

where PACKAGEROOT is where you unzipped the GURLS package. This will add all the important directories 
to your path. Run 'savepath' if you want the installation to be permanent.

Documentation
=============

- GURLS design is described here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-Design

- Demos
	GURLS has exstensively commented demos in the "demo" subdirectory. 
	Have a look, and run gurls_helloworld.m. We feel this is the best way to learn how to use
	these packages.

- A Quick reference with several examples can be found here:
	https://github.com/LCSL/GURLS/blob/master/gurls/guide-train-test.pdf?raw=true

- A User manual can be found here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-GURLS_Usage

- A collection of the most useful and common pipelines can be found here:
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/3-User-Manual#wiki-Examples_in_GURLS
	
- Description of the available methods, demos and data for each package can be found at
	https://github.com/CBCL/GURLS/wiki/4-Code-Description#wiki-GURLS

- Developer's Guide
	A simple developer's guides is available in the gurls-manual.pdf file.
	GURLS is designed for easy expansion. Give it a try!


Quick start
===========
A straightforward example of GURLS usage can be found in gurls_helloworld.m, 
which employs gurls_train and gurls_test functions. 
The most important functionalities of the library can be controlled just
by using gurls_train and gurls_test with the appropriate options.

Below we describe more in details how to use them on your data.

Put your training data in a n-by-d matrix X with each row being a data sample.
Put the training labels in a y n-by-one vector. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T 
being the number of classes.

Run:

>> model = gurls_train(X, y);

This will train a non-linear model based on a gaussian kernel and validated by hold out cross validation.

Put your test data in a n-by-d matrix Xte like above and your test labels in 
a n-by-one vector yte. Let the labels go from 1 to T with T being the number of classes.

Run: 

>> [ypred, acc] = gurls_test(model, Xte, yte)

This will compute the outputs predicted by the model with the associated accuracy.
